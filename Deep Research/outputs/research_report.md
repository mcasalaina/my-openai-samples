# Current Research on Orca Intelligence and Communication

## Introduction 
Orcas (also known as killer whales, *Orcinus orca*) have long been recognized as highly intelligent marine mammals. Recent studies underscore their remarkable cognitive abilities, complex social lives, and sophisticated communication systems,. Scientists have documented orcas solving problems and learning novel behaviors, maintaining intricate social bonds and even **cultural traditions** that differ between groups<sup>3</sup>,<sup>6</sup>. Researchers are also exploring the structure of orca vocalizations – from their use of distinct calls and potential dialects to the question of whether these sounds constitute a form of language. Below is a detailed overview of the current scientific understanding of orca intelligence and communication, including findings from recent research on their problem-solving, social interactions, cultural behaviors, and vocal communication systems.

## Orca Cognitive Abilities and Problem-Solving 
Orcas rank among the most **cognitively complex** animals on the planet. They possess one of the largest brains of any marine mammal (up to ~15 pounds or 6.8 kg) and an encephalization level comparable to that of chimpanzees,. Such neurological endowment reflects in their **learning capacity and adaptability**. In both wild and captive settings, orcas have demonstrated innovative problem-solving skills and learning through imitation and experience. Notably, they can **devise new hunting tactics and tools**, showing an ability to adapt to challenges in their environment.

- *Cooperative Hunting Strategies:* In the wild, orcas employ sophisticated coordinated hunts that indicate planning and teamwork. For example, Antarctic orcas use a *“wave washing”* technique – swimming in unison to create waves that wash seals off ice floes – requiring precise synchronization and learning from trial and error , . Other populations will intentionally beach themselves to grab prey onshore or work together to corral fish or even take down large whales, demonstrating remarkable strategic cooperation<sup>3</sup>. These tactics are not instinctual alone; they are learned and refined within each pod, often varying by region.  

- *Innovative Problem-Solving:* Orcas are known to **invent novel behaviors** to obtain food or interact with their environment, and such innovations can spread socially. A famous example is a young orca in captivity who began **spitting regurgitated fish onto the water’s surface to bait gulls**, then ambushing the birds – effectively inventing a fishing trick. This clever behavior spread to other orcas at the facility, one of the clearest demonstrations of social learning in cetaceans,. In the wild, orcas have learned to **steal fish from human fishing lines** (a behavior called depredation) and to manipulate novel objects. A small group of orcas off the Iberian Peninsula even figured out how to disable sailing boats by ramming and biting the boats’ rudders – a *“new trick”* scientists suspect was learned from one or two bold individuals and then copied by others<sup>3</sup>,<sup>3</sup>. These examples highlight the orca’s ability to **innovate solutions** to challenges and then transmit those solutions socially.

- *Vocal and Imitative Learning:* Orcas also exhibit advanced **imitative abilities**, which are a facet of problem-solving and learning. In captivity, they can be trained to understand novel commands and even mimic sounds from other species. In one study, a captive orca successfully **imitated human words** (like “hello” or counting “one, two, three”) and other unfamiliar sounds on command,. While the orca did not understand the meaning of the words, the experiment proved orcas are capable of precisely controlling their vocal output to match new sounds – a trait known as **open-ended vocal learning**. This ability to learn and repeat novel behaviors or sounds underscores the flexibility and intelligence of the species.

These cognitive feats – coordinated group hunting, inventive foraging methods, and cross-species vocal mimicry – all illustrate that orcas are adept problem solvers. They can assess situations, **learn from others, adapt their behavior**, and even spontaneously **invent new behaviors** when needed. In many cases, what one orca learns can quickly become shared knowledge within its social group, reflecting both intelligence and the strong **social learning** component of orca behavior,<sup>3</sup>.

## Social Interactions and Complex Societies 
Orcas live in some of the most **complex social structures** observed in non-human animals. They are extremely social, forming tight-knit family groups called **pods** that can persist over many decades. A typical pod is a **matrilineal unit** – often led by an older female (matriarch) – consisting of her offspring and subsequent generations. Both male and female orcas commonly remain with their mother’s family for life, resulting in stable, multi-generational social units<sup>6</sup>,<sup>5</sup>. Within these groups, orcas exhibit rich social behaviors, strong bonds, and even distinct individual relationships, akin to friendships.

Recent research using drones to observe orca pods from above has revealed nuanced details of their **social networks**. Even in these permanent family groups, orcas show preferences for social partners: individuals spend disproportionately more time interacting with particular pod-mates, often those of similar age or the same sex,. Younger whales and females tend to be especially **central in social interactions**, engaging in frequent physical contact and social play, while older individuals (especially older males) become less socially central as they age. Such findings suggest that orcas form **friendships and subgroups** within the pod – a level of social complexity comparable to that seen in primates. Observations show orcas are highly tactile: they rub body surfaces, swim in synchrony, and breach or surface together, all of which appear to reinforce social bonds. Physical contact in many species (including humans) has calming, bond‐strengthening effects, and orcas’ frequent touching and synchronized breathing or surfacing may serve a similar social function.

The social life of orcas also includes **play and ritual**. Pods have been seen engaging in group play activities – tossing around objects like kelp, riding waves, and even playing with live prey (such as porpoises) without consuming them, presumably as a form of social play or practice hunting<sup>4</sup>,<sup>4</sup>. In the Pacific Northwest, orcas have been observed “playing” with crab pot floats and boat rudders, behavior some researchers interpret as playfulness or curiosity in these intelligent animals<sup>4</sup>,<sup>4</sup>. Orcas also perform what researchers describe as **elaborate greeting ceremonies**: when two pods meet after time apart, they sometimes line up facing each other, then converge in a flurry of interactive behaviors – a scene likened to a joyful *“killer whale mosh pit”* by one observer<sup>6</sup>. Such rituals suggest a level of social protocol and excitement when groups reunite.

Notably, orcas appear to experience and express emotions in their social interactions. Field observations report behaviors interpretable as **grief or empathy**. In one well-known instance, a female orca (of the Southern Resident population) carried her dead calf at the water’s surface for **17 days**, refusing to let it go – a poignant “tour of grief” that captivated scientists and the public<sup>3</sup>. Orcas have also been seen gently supporting sick or injured pod mates at the surface to help them breathe, and there are documented cases of females (especially post-reproductive matriarchs) *babysitting* calves that are not their own. This suggests a capacity for **caregiving and empathy** within the pod. While interpreting animal emotions is complex, such displays – along with the strong social bonds observed (e.g. remaining with family for life, and distress in the absence of companions) – indicate that orca societies are built on deep social ties and perhaps emotional intelligence<sup>3</sup>.

Overall, orcas exhibit a **level of social organization and interaction** that is exceptionally advanced. Each pod operates as a close family unit with coordinated activities (traveling, hunting, socializing) and a clear **role for learning and mentorship** – elder orcas often lead group movements and can share knowledge (such as remembering where seasonal prey or safe waterways are) that benefits the whole pod<sup>6</sup>. The combination of long life span (often 50+ years), prolonged maternal care, and stable group membership creates an environment where learned behaviors and social knowledge can accumulate over generations. This social structure lays the foundation for what scientists recognize as **orca culture**.

## Cultural Behaviors and Traditions in Orcas 
Culture in animals is defined as behaviors that are learned socially and shared within a group. Among non-human species, orcas stand out as having one of the most complex and well-documented cultural systems<sup>6</sup>,. Many aspects of an orca’s lifestyle – from what it eats to how it communicates and plays – are not just products of instinct or genetic adaptation, but are **culturally inherited** from the pod. Recent scientific investigations have illuminated several dimensions of orca culture:

1. **Dietary Specializations:** Different orca populations often have strong preferences for certain prey, and these dietary habits are culturally transmitted. For example, the “resident” orcas of the North Pacific (e.g. in the Salish Sea) feed mainly on fish, especially Chinook salmon, and mothers actively share catches with their calves – teaching the younger generation to prefer these fish<sup>6</sup>. In contrast, nearby “transient” orcas (Bigg’s orcas) in the same region feed almost exclusively on marine mammals (seals, porpoises, sea lions) and virtually never eat fish<sup>6</sup>,<sup>4</sup>. These two populations live in overlapping waters but have completely different food cultures (and correspondingly different hunting tactics and social behaviors) despite being the same species. Other groups show similarly distinct traditions: **offshore orcas** off the Pacific coast specialize in eating sharks – so much so that their teeth are often worn down by the rough shark skin<sup>6</sup>. In Antarctic waters, one orca ecotype preys mostly on penguins, while another nearby group targets minke whales<sup>6</sup>. These preferences are maintained within each community and calves learn what to hunt by following their mothers. It’s notable that such strong dietary segregation is not genetically based – genetically, these groups are extremely similar – which means the differences arise from learned tradition. In short, what an orca eats is largely determined by **the culture of its pod** rather than innate prey drive, a striking parallel to human cultural food preferences.

2. **Hunting Techniques and Tools:** Along with diet, orcas develop **specialized hunting techniques** that are passed down socially. Researchers have catalogued numerous complex hunting methods unique to certain pods or regions, underscoring cultural learning. For instance, *wave-washing*, described earlier, is a skillful cooperative strategy that Antarctic orcas have perfected for knocking prey off ice – juveniles likely learn by observing experienced adults . In Patagonia, orcas intentionally *strand* themselves on beaches to grab seal pups from the shoreline, then wriggle back to sea – a high-risk hunting method taught from mother to calf over years of practice<sup>3</sup>. In Norway, orcas employ **“carousel feeding”** to capture herring: a pod herds a school of fish into a tight ball by circling and blowing bubbles, then stuns the herring with tail slaps before feeding . This elaborate, coordinated technique is *learned* behavior unique to those Norwegian orcas – young whales learn the procedure step by step from elders, showing clear cultural transmission . Pods elsewhere do not automatically know these tactics; they develop their own. There are even reports of orcas using **tools or props**: for example, some orcas delicately carry and use a fish as bait to lure birds (as noted earlier), and others have been seen holding conch shells in their mouths to coax curious fish inside (anecdotal observations by fishermen). The key point is that orcas not only **innovate such hunting solutions**, but they also *teach them* to peers and offspring. A successful new technique can spread through a population – scientists have observed new hunting behaviors increasing in prevalence over time as others copy the innovators,. This diffusion of learned behavior is hallmark evidence of culture.

3. **Social Customs and Play:** Orca culture is not limited to feeding – it extends to social behaviors and recreational habits. For example, certain resident orca communities in British Columbia engage in a peculiar habit called *“beach rubbing”*: they repeatedly slide their bodies over shallow pebble beaches, a behavior thought to be pleasurable or for skin care. Interestingly, other orca groups in the same region **do not** do this, even though the opportunity (pebbled beaches) is available<sup>6</sup>. This indicates beach rubbing is a culturally preferred activity in some pods but not others. Likewise, **greeting ceremonies** – as described in the previous section – are regularly observed in some resident pods, but are absent in others nearby<sup>6</sup>. Variations in playful behaviors are also noted: some groups are far more exuberant, frequently tail-slapping, spyhopping, and breaching, while others are relatively covert and quiet (for instance, Bigg’s/transient orcas tend to avoid noisy play while hunting mammals, presumably to keep stealthy)<sup>6</sup>,<sup>4</sup>. These differences illustrate that orcas have **group-specific “traditions”** for how to socialize and play, on top of the necessities of feeding.

4. **Transient Fads and Innovations:** Orcas are capable of **spontaneous innovations** that can catch on quickly within a pod – analogous to short-lived cultural fads in humans. One striking example occurred in the 1980s: a group of orcas in the Pacific Northwest began **wearing dead salmon on their heads** like hats. This odd behavior apparently began with one or two individuals and then spread to others in the population, becoming a trend before disappearing shortly thereafter<sup>3</sup>. Scientists interpret this as a form of play or social display – essentially a fad. Another recent example of a “cultural fad” is the well-documented trend of orcas in Iberian waters interacting with boats. Starting around 2020, a few orcas off Spain and Portugal began antagonizing small sailboats (especially biting at rudders), and over the next few years at least 20 orcas in that population adopted the behavior<sup>3</sup>. The fact that it is **limited to that one community** and has spread primarily among younger orcas (who likely emulate the adults) strongly suggests this is a socially learned behavior, not a random occurrence<sup>3</sup>. These ephemeral innovations show how **quickly orcas can pick up new behaviors from each other**, reflecting a dynamic cultural capacity.

5. **Cross-Generational Traditions:** Many orca behaviors persist as traditions that endure across generations – sometimes for many decades. For instance, the distinct **vocal dialects** (call repertoires) of a pod can remain stable over at least several generations, with only gradual changes over time<sup>6</sup>. Preferred migration routes, beach rubbing sites, and prey choices (as discussed) are passed from older to younger orcas. One remarkable study of Pacific Northwest orcas looked at a puzzling behavior of **“phocoenacide”** – the repeated harassment and killing of porpoises without eating them. Researchers found this behavior has been occurring for **nearly 60 years** among certain fish-eating orcas and has been *passed down through generations and across social groupings*<sup>3</sup>. Young orcas that witness adults engage in this porpoise-chasing seemingly adopt it as an acceptable (if still puzzling) activity. The study concluded that this is *“an amazing example of killer whale culture”*, where a non-essential behavior persists simply because it is learned and socially reinforced<sup>3</sup>. Similarly, the long-term persistence of specialized hunting techniques (like carousel feeding in Norwegian orcas or seal-hunting tactics in specific Antarctic pods) attests that orcas can maintain very stable cultural traditions. Over time, these traditions can become so strong that they act as unwritten rules – for example, Southern Resident orcas stick to eating Chinook salmon and show **reluctance to switch prey** even when their preferred salmon runs decline, a rigidity that has been attributed to cultural preference overriding opportunism<sup>6</sup>. Such cases illustrate that orca societies have *culture* in a meaningful sense: socially learned behaviors that shape their lives as much as ecological or genetic factors do.

In summary, the current scientific view is that orcas have one of the most sophisticated cultural systems among non-humans. Learned behaviors are numerous and varied, covering feeding, social interaction, and communication patterns. Different orca communities develop their own “culture” – with unique dialects, diets, and habits – much like human cultures, and these differences are maintained by **social learning** rather than genetic divergence. This recognition of orca culture has important implications: it means that to conserve orcas, one must consider not just the animals themselves, but also their cultural knowledge (for example, loss of certain members could mean loss of specific learned behaviors or call traditions). Ongoing studies continue to discover new facets of these cetaceans’ cultural lives, reinforcing that orcas are not only intelligent and social, but are **culture-bearing animals**.

## Communication Systems: Vocalizations and Dialects 
One of the most active areas of orca research is the study of their **communication system**, often colloquially referred to as orca “language.” Orcas rely on sound as their primary means of communicating and sensing the world, and they produce a rich repertoire of vocalizations. Understanding the structure and function of these vocal signals is key to deciphering how orcas share information and maintain social bonds.

**Vocal Repertoire:** Orcas make **three main types of sounds**:
- **Clicks:** Rapid broadband clicks used primarily for echolocation (sonar). Orcas emit click trains to navigate and locate prey, listening for echoes – a sensory tool rather than a communicative “language,” though click patterns may sometimes also convey alert signals to other orcas nearby<sup>2</sup>.
- **Whistles:** Tonal, continuous sounds used in social contexts. Many dolphin species use whistles extensively for communication, but orcas surprisingly use whistles **relatively rarely**<sup>2</sup>. Whistles in orcas tend to occur during close-range social interactions and may serve to express excitement or friendly contact.
- **Pulsed Calls (Discrete Calls):** These are the most prominent elements of orca vocal communication. A pulsed call is a short (0.5–2 second) vocalization with a distinct pattern of tones or pulses, often described as sounding like squeals, squawks, or trumpeting sounds. Orca calls can be **monophonic** (single fundamental frequency) or **biphonic** (two tones at once, creating a characteristic overlaying sound). Each call type has a specific pattern of frequency modulation (pitch changes) and overtone structure. Orcas use these calls in a variety of social situations – from maintaining contact between individuals to coordinating group movements or expressing alarm. Many calls seem to be affiliative (helping pod members stay connected) while others may be used during foraging or other specific behaviors. The complexity of these calls provides a lot of information potential: researchers can tell apart calls of different emotional valence or context (for instance, certain calls tend to occur during socializing at the surface, whereas different calls might be more common during foraging dives)<sup>1</sup>,<sup>1</sup>. Importantly, *each orca population has its own repertoire* of discrete call types.

**Dialects and Group Signatures:** Perhaps the most striking feature of orca communication is that they have identifiable **dialects**. A dialect is a unique set of call types and patterns shared by members of a particular group. Decades of research (pioneered in the 1970s and 1980s by scientists like John Ford) have shown that orca pods can be recognized by their calls alone,<sup>2</sup>. For example, in the Northeast Pacific, the Southern Resident orcas have at least 25 identified discrete call types, the Northern Residents have their own overlapping but distinct set, and the Transient (Bigg’s) orcas have a much smaller call repertoire (and use calls more sparsely) distinct from the resident fish-eaters<sup>2</sup>. Even within the Southern Resident community, each pod (J, K, and L pod) has slight variations or unique calls – akin to regional accents within a language<sup>2</sup>. These dialects are **stable family traditions**: calves adopt the call repertoire of their mother and close kin. Because pods often stay separate (especially residents vs transients), their call repertoires diverge over time, much like languages evolving. In fact, clans of related pods have been defined in residents that share some calls (indicating ancient common ancestry), but have distinct dialects as different from each other as, say, *“Greek and Russian”* are in human languages<sup>6</sup>. The difference is so pronounced that two orca groups in the same area will not understand each other’s calls – a transient orca and a resident orca sound “foreign” to one another. These dialects are not genetically determined; they are **learned socially**, which is a hallmark of culture. Young orcas learn the specific calls of their family. If an orca is moved to a different social group (as occasionally happened in aquarium settings or if pods split and reform), they have even been observed to *adjust their calls* over time to match their new associates – evidence of vocal learning and **accommodation** to a social dialect,. In one case, researchers noted that captive orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins for several years began to modify their calls, incorporating dolphin-like whistles and click patterns, essentially learning elements of the dolphin “language”,. This flexibility underscores that orca dialects are not hard-wired; they are learned conventions – the orca equivalent of a cultural accent.

**Function of Calls:** Each orca call dialect likely carries specific information or functions for the group. While scientists are still deciphering the “dictionary” of orca calls, some patterns are known:
- Certain calls appear to be **contact calls** used to maintain group cohesion when pods spread out. For example, a distinct call type might be used by a mother and calf to stay in touch if separated by distance or poor visibility. Researchers have noted that call rates often increase during *socializing* or when orcas are regrouping after being apart.
- Some calls are associated with particular activities. In their study of Antarctic Type C orcas, Wellard et al. (2020) noted differences in calling behavior between periods of traveling, foraging under ice, and socializing, suggesting the whales adjust their vocalizations to the context (more calls during active social periods, fewer during intense hunting). Transient orcas (who hunt mammals with good hearing) often **remain silent** or use very low-amplitude calls while hunting, presumably to avoid alerting prey, whereas resident fish-hunting orcas are far more vocal during foraging since fish (like salmon) cannot hear those frequencies well<sup>4</sup>. This indicates orcas can tactically modulate communication depending on circumstance.
- Some calls may serve to **coordinate group movements or hunts** – for instance, prior to a synchronized wave wash or group dive, orcas often exchange a series of calls, possibly to align the group’s actions. There are documented “excited” call bouts when orcas converge on prey or when multiple pods meet, suggesting emotional arousal or signals to synchronize behavior.
- It’s also suspected that certain pulsed calls could convey identity information (which group is calling) and even an individual’s identity or state. Orca calls often have unique acoustic signatures to the group, but individual voice characteristics can sometimes be discerned. Unlike bottlenose dolphins, orcas haven’t shown a clear use of individual *“name”* whistles, but ongoing research is examining if orcas have signature call variants or rhythmic patterns that family members recognize as a specific individual.

**Vocal Learning and Flexibility:** Orcas are among the few mammal species that are **vocal learners** – they can acquire new sounds through imitation. This is a rare trait (humans are the prime example among mammals, along with some bats, some cetaceans like dolphins, and a few others). The **open-ended vocal learning** in orcas is evidenced by the dialect differences and experiments like the one with the captive female “Wikie” who learned to mimic human words,. In that 2018 study, researchers used a “copy” command and demonstrated that Wikie could listen to a novel sound (whether another orca’s unfamiliar call or a human word) and reproduce a recognizably similar sound within a few tries. Another orca in captivity was documented spontaneously imitating the whistles of dolphins after being moved to a pool with them. Such abilities show that orcas have fine control over their vocal organs and learn sounds socially. This learning ability is essential for maintaining dialects and possibly for inventing new calls. For instance, slight modifications or “slang” in calls might spread through a pod over time. (Some researchers have even noted what could be the orca equivalent of changing “speech patterns” – young orcas sometimes experiment with call structure, though they tend to conform to the traditional pod calls as they mature, aside from minor variations that can accumulate as cultural drift,.)

**Potential for Language-Like Structure:** The question of whether orca communication constitutes a true “language” (with grammar or semantics) remains open. We do know it’s **highly complex and contextual**. Recent advances in machine learning are starting to shed light on possible *meaning* in orca calls. In 2023, computer scientists applied neural network models to orca vocalization recordings paired with observed behaviors. Remarkably, the algorithm could predict with about **96% accuracy** what behavior or context (e.g. hunting, socializing, traveling) was happening based only on analyzing the sounds. In other words, specific vocal patterns correlated strongly with specific behaviors, to the point that an AI could reliably decode context from the calls. The researchers suggest this is evidence that orca calls **carry semantic information** – essentially, certain calls or sound combinations might *signal* or *reference* particular activities or intentions. For example, a particular sequence of calls might consistently precede a group’s collective dive to hunt, implying a call that means “let’s hunt now” or at least communicates readiness. Another call might occur when a group is resting or when mothers are calling calves, etc. The study authors cautiously phrased it as evidence that orcas have a *“semantic language”*, though not language in the human sense of complex grammar, it does hint that many orca vocalizations are meaningful signals linked to real-world references (like behaviors or objects). 

Additionally, the structure of orca calls has features that fascinate linguists and biologists. Some calls consist of multiple components (a beginning and end part, for instance) that could be analogous to syllables or phrases. Orcas may string calls together into sequences, and there’s evidence that they can **combine sound units** in different ways. Whether this amounts to a syntactic structure (rules for ordering elements to convey different meanings) is still unknown. So far, orca communication appears to be primarily a system of distinct calls, each used in certain contexts, rather than a flexible grammar of recombining elements as human language is. However, the full picture is not yet clear. Field researchers and a number of projects (some employing AI and underwater recording networks) are actively trying to decode orca vocal communication at a deeper level. Given orcas’ proven cognitive abilities and social complexity, many scientists consider it plausible that orcas have **highly advanced communication**, potentially with elements of real language – such as referential calls (specific sounds that refer to specific objects, events, or individuals) or even names for each other – though conclusive evidence of the latter is still forthcoming.

What is already firmly established is that orcas use vocal communication to maintain their social structure and coordinate behavior, and that these vocal behaviors are culturally transmitted. An orca’s dialect is a product of its family’s traditions, and individuals can perceive the difference between calls of their own community and those of others. Playbacks of unfamiliar orca calls can elicit strong reactions – in some cases, other orcas might go silent or become cautious when hearing calls not from their own group (since, for example, transient orca calls may signal danger to a resident orca, as transients are predators of other marine mammals). This shows that **orca vocalizations convey identity and possibly intent**.

## Conclusion 
Research into orca intelligence and “language” has revealed a creature with **mental and social capacities among the highest observed in non-humans**. Orcas demonstrate intelligence through their problem-solving skills, learning aptitude, and even the transmission of knowledge within their groups. They live in complex social societies, complete with friendships, lifelong family ties, and cultural norms that influence everything from their diet to their play styles,<sup>3</sup>. Perhaps most striking is the **cultural richness** of orca populations – distinct clans and pods have unique dialects, hunting techniques, and social customs passed down through generations, an analogue to human cultures<sup>6</sup>,. Their communication system, while not fully decoded, is intricate and tailored to their social needs and environment. Ongoing studies – including machine learning analyses of orca calls and long-term behavioral observations – are inching closer to understanding the extent of meaning in their vocalizations. All evidence so far suggests that orcas have a sophisticated communication network that, if not language by strict definition, is a very nuanced and information-rich mode of exchange shaped by both biology and culture.

Scientists are continuing to explore questions such as: *How specific is the information orcas convey with each call? Do orcas have vocal signals for individual identities or particular objects (names or labels)? How do their large brains process and learn these vocal and social patterns?* As research tools improve (underwater drones, AI pattern recognition, etc.), we are likely to uncover even more about the inner workings of orca societies. What is already clear is that appreciating orca intelligence and communication requires viewing these animals not just as instinct-driven creatures, but as **sentient beings with traditions, social rules, and possibly even a form of language**. Such understanding adds urgency to conservation efforts – preserving orcas is not only about saving individuals but also about preserving their unique cultures and the knowledge each orca community holds. The current state of research paints orcas as truly extraordinary: apex predators with keen intelligence, capable of learning, cooperation, cultural transmission, and complex communication – a combination that places them among the most intellectually and socially advanced species on Earth.
