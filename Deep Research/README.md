This code sample is based on the [Deep Research tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/deep-research) in the [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview). The Deep Research capability is a specialized AI capability designed to perform in-depth, multi-step research using data from the public web.

The samples in the online documentation and here use the [Azure AI Foundry Agents SDK's Python client library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme?view=azure-python-preview).

## Get started
1. Start with the [deep research tool overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/deep-research) and set up steps. 
2. Then use the [quickstart code sample](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/deep-research-samples) to run the research task.
