# Welcome
This repo is a work-in-progress compilation of my samples based on [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) and [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) offered models.

These samples are intended to simply convey the concepts and capabilities with code samples that are concise but sufficient to show how Generative AI can be applied to real-world scenarios.

# Azure OpenAI or OpenAI
Most samples will use the common Python SDK that supports both Azure OpenAI and OpenAI service and credentials. 

I will mostly be using Azure OpenAI service and credentials  because it's personally convenient. Regardless, the features and samples typically will be applicable to both services.


# List

1. **Functions**: Showcases the new "functions" feature with a simple example that transforms the user input into pre-defined functions invoked from the code, and the output sent back to GPT to get a natural language response, completing the semantic-syntactical-semantic loop.
